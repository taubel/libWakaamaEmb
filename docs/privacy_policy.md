# Google Analytics

Like millions of other websites, this page uses Google Analytics. Google Analytics monitors the activity of users of the website, which allows us to improve the quality of the content. Google Analytics uses cookies, a small piece of information stored on your computer, to uniquely identify each visitor.

The information collected by Google Analytics includes:

* what website you came from (for example github.com)
* what pages did you visit on here
* how long did you stay

We use these data to understand how people use the website (https://openhab-nodes.github.io/wakaamaNode/) so as to improve them. 
For example, we know for sure that the present page is read by very very few people and therefore it deserves less effort than the rest of the site.
We never sell or share this data to anyone else.
